x = 1 # no symble or var ahead of variable
y = 2.5 #float
name = 'Andrew' #str

# Multiple assingment
x, y, name, is_cool = (1, 2.5, 'Andrew', True)

# Basic Math
a = x + y

# exponents
# x = 2**2

# integer division
x = 64 // 10 


# Modulous operator gives the remainder of divsion of numbers
a = 5 % 2 

# 


# print(type(x)) prints type of variable



# print(x, y, name, is_cool)
